    "content": "<div><p>Traditionally, web content has been tightly coupled with its presentation layer, often managed through monolithic Content Management Systems (CMS). While powerful, this approach can introduce rigidity and complexity. This essay explores an alternative: managing content through simple, version-controlled JSON files.</p><p>By decoupling the 'what' (content) from the 'how' (presentation), developers and content creators gain immense freedom. This architecture simplifies the deployment pipeline, enables programmatic content manipulation, and makes the entire system more resilient and transparent. We'll discuss the practical benefits, from faster performance to easier collaboration, and outline a blueprint for building a fast, modern, JSON-powered website.</p></div>",
